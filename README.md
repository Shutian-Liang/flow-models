# Simple implement for basic flow models

Just implement different flow based model(not restricted to flow matching) for image generation using cifar10 dataset. I write this for self-learninig.

The motivation is:
- Since diffusion is a special type of flow model(just as kaiming said in CVPR2025), **why flow based model is not well used in the image generation** ?
- **Is there other alternatives for flow models** ?
